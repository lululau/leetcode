  Result table:
  +-------------+----------------+
  | customer_id | count_no_trans |
  +-------------+----------------+
  | 54          | 2              |

  | 96          | 1              |
  +-------------+----------------+
  Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
  Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
  Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
  Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
  Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
  As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
