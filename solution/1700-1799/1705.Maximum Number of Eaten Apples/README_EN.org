There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for n
days. On the ith day, the tree grows apples[i] apples that will rot
after days[i] days, that is on day i + days[i] the apples will be rotten
and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any
apples, which are denoted by apples[i] == 0 and days[i] == 0.

#+begin_html
  <pre>
  <strong>Input:</strong> apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]
  <strong>Output:</strong> 7
  <strong>Explanation:</strong> You can eat 7 apples:
  - On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.
  - On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
  - On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day. After this day, the apples that grew on the third day rot.
  - On the fourth to the seventh days, you eat apples that grew on the fourth day.
