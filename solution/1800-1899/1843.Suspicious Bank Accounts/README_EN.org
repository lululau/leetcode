A bank account is suspicious if the total income exceeds the max_income
for this account for two or more consecutive months. The total income of
an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month
(i.e., transactions of the type 'Creditor').

  | 10             | 3          | Creditor | 102100 | 2021-06-15 10:37:16 |
  | 14             | 4          | Creditor | 56300  | 2021-07-21 12:12:25 |
  | 19             | 4          | Debtor   | 101100 | 2021-05-09 15:21:49 |
  | 8              | 3          | Creditor | 64900  | 2021-07-26 15:09:56 |
  | 7              | 3          | Creditor | 90900  | 2021-06-14 11:23:07 |
  +----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+

  Result table:
  +------------+
  | account_id |
  +------------+
  | 3          |
  +------------+

  For account 3:
  - In 6-2021, the user had an income of 107100 + 102100 + 90900 = 300100.
  - In 7-2021, the user had an income of 64900.
  We can see that the income exceeded the max income of 21000 for two consecutive months, so we include 3 in the result table.

  For account 4:
  - In 5-2021, the user had an income of 49300.
  - In 6-2021, the user had an income of 10400.
  - In 7-2021, the user had an income of 56300.
  We can see that the income exceeded the max income in May and July, but not in June. Since the account did not exceed the max income for two consecutive months, we do not include it in the result table.
