  session_id is the primary key for this table.
  customer_id is the ID of the customer watching this session.
  The session runs during the <strong>inclusive</strong> interval between start_time and end_time.
  It is guaranteed that start_time &lt;= end_time and that two sessions for the same customer do not intersect.</pre>

  +------------+
  The ad with ID 1 was shown to user 1 at time 5 while they were in session 1.
  The ad with ID 2 was shown to user 2 at time 17 while they were in session 4.
  The ad with ID 3 was shown to user 2 at time 20 while they were in session 4.
  We can see that sessions 1 and 4 had at least one ad. Sessions 2, 3, and 5 did not have any ads, so we return them.</pre>
