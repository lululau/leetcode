  | Column Name | Type    |

  | employee_id | int     |

  | name        | varchar |

  | salary      | int     |

  +-------------+---------+

  employee_id is the primary key for this table.

A company wants to divide the employees into teams such that all the
members on each team have the same salary. The teams should follow these
criteria:

#+begin_html
  </p>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <ul>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <li>
#+end_html

Each team should consist of at least two employees.

#+begin_html
  </li>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <li>
#+end_html

All the employees on a team should have the same salary.

#+begin_html
  </li>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <li>
#+end_html

All the employees of the same salary should be assigned to the same
team.

#+begin_html
  </li>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <li>
#+end_html

If the salary of an employee is unique, we do not assign this employee
to any team.

#+begin_html
  </li>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <li>
#+end_html

A team's ID is assigned based on the rank of the team's salary relative
to the other teams' salaries, where the team with the lowest salary has
team_id = 1. Note that the salaries for employees not on a team are not
included in this ranking.

Write an SQL query to get the team_id of each employee that is in a
team.

#+begin_html
  </p>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <p>
#+end_html

Return the result table ordered by team_id in ascending order. In case
of a tie, order it by employee_id in ascending order.

#+begin_html
  </p>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <p>
#+end_html

The query result format is in the following example:

#+begin_html
  </p>
#+end_html

#+begin_html
  <p>
#+end_html

  Employees table:

  +-------------+---------+--------+

  | employee_id | name    | salary |

  +-------------+---------+--------+

  | 2           | Meir    | 3000   |

  | 3           | Michael | 3000   |

  | 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |

  | 8           | Juan    | 6100   |

  | 9           | Kannon  | 7400   |

  +-------------+---------+--------+



  Result table:

  +-------------+---------+--------+---------+

  | employee_id | name    | salary | team_id |

  +-------------+---------+--------+---------+

  | 2           | Meir    | 3000   | 1       |

  | 3           | Michael | 3000   | 1       |

  | 7           | Addilyn | 7400   | 2       |

  | 9           | Kannon  | 7400   | 2       |

  +-------------+---------+--------+---------+



  Meir (employee_id=2) and Michael (employee_id=3) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 3000.

  Addilyn (employee_id=7) and Kannon (employee_id=9) are in the same team because they have the same salary of 7400.

  Juan (employee_id=8) is not included in any team because their salary of 6100 is unique (i.e. no other employee has the same salary).

  The team IDs are assigned as follows (based on salary ranking, lowest first):

  - team_id=1: Meir and Michael, salary of 3000

  - team_id=2: Addilyn and Kannon, salary of 7400

  Juan&#39;s salary of 6100 is not included in the ranking because they are not on a team.</pre>
