  (player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.

Write an SQL query that reports for each player and date, how many games
played so far by the player. That is, the total number of games played
by the player until that date. Check the example for clarity.

  Result table:
  +-----------+------------+---------------------+
  | player_id | event_date | games_played_so_far |
  +-----------+------------+---------------------+
  | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 5                   |
  | 1         | 2016-05-02 | 11                  |
  | 1         | 2017-06-25 | 12                  |
  | 3         | 2016-03-02 | 0                   |
  | 3         | 2018-07-03 | 5                   |
  +-----------+------------+---------------------+
  For the player with id 1, 5 + 6 = 11 games played by 2016-05-02, and 5 + 6 + 1 = 12 games played by 2017-06-25.
  For the player with id 3, 0 + 5 = 5 games played by 2018-07-03.
  Note that for each player we only care about the days when the player logged in.
