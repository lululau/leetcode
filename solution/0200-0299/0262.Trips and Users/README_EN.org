  Id is the primary key for this table.
  The table holds all taxi trips. Each trip has a unique Id, while Client_Id and Driver_Id are foreign keys to the Users_Id at the Users table.
  Status is an ENUM type of (&lsquo;completed&rsquo;, &lsquo;cancelled_by_driver&rsquo;, &lsquo;cancelled_by_client&rsquo;).

Write a SQL query to find the cancellation rate of requests with
unbanned users (both client and driver must not be banned) each day
between "2013-10-01" and "2013-10-03".

#+begin_html
  </p>

The cancellation rate is computed by dividing the number of canceled (by
client or driver) requests with unbanned users by the total number of
requests with unbanned users on that day.

Return the result table in any order. Round Cancellation Rate to two
decimal points.

  On 2013-10-01:
    - There were 4 requests in total, 2 of which were canceled.
    - However, the request with Id=2 was made by a banned client (User_Id=2), so it is ignored in the calculation.
    - Hence there are 3 unbanned requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
    - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 3) = 0.33
  On 2013-10-02:
    - There were 3 requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
    - The request with Id=6 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
    - Hence there are 2 unbanned requests in total, 0 of which were canceled.
    - The Cancellation Rate is (0 / 2) = 0.00
  On 2013-10-03:
    - There were 3 requests in total, 1 of which was canceled.
    - The request with Id=8 was made by a banned client, so it is ignored.
    - Hence there are 2 unbanned request in total, 1 of which were canceled.
    - The Cancellation Rate is (1 / 2) = 0.50
